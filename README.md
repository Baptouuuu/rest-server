This library contains a set of tools to define, validate, extract and expose resources through http in a REST manner. However it doesn't provide any routing capabilities.

For an example of implementation please refer to [`innmind/rest-server-bundle`](https://packagist.org/packages/innmind/rest-server-bundle).

## Installation

Via composer:

```sh
composer require innmind/rest-server
```
